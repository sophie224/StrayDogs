                    Hi! I am Mura, a stray dog from Tbilisi. I am
                    friendly to anyone who comes to pet me, but I
                    dream to find my own home and lifelong friend
                    one day. I spend my days with my friends,
                    people feed us sometimes;

                <p>
                    Mostly the owners of pizzeria give us some leftovers. But you can never know what will happen
                    today. Join me today, a day that can decide my
                    whole life.

                    Usually dogs never know where they will wake
                    up or go in the morning, but in my case I am
                    more than sure I will wake up either in Freedom
                    Square or Rike Park

                <p>
                    I love the atmosphere in those places. One is usually full of people, another full of a quiet
                    environment. In both places we (dogs) are welcome and
                    are happy to see people’s attention towards us.

                    Every day I wake up in the morning on the Freedom square, the first thing I think about is the
                    foodstuff. I go down to the street where many
                    shops and a huge restaurant is located. I adore
                    the food this restaurant is serving
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chef is a very good man and he knows how
                    to steal my heart; every morning I visit him for
                    feeding and he delivers the best butterscotch
                    prepared for me. Once energised, I am ready
                    to visit my friends and have some fun with
                    them. One of them is Sara.

                    Every day I wake up in the morning in Rike park.
                    The green atmosphere here is wonderful. My
                    friends usually visit me in the morning and join me
                    for breakfast. Sometimes it's easy to find a place
                    for a meal, sometimes not
                </p>
                <p>
                    However there is always a chance to drive people’s
                    hearts and make a hint with a facial expression that you
                    need a care and a foodsponser. I usually use this tool but
                    then regret because people start feeling sorry for me and
                    it seems I am losing myself. For this, a very close friend
                    of mine, Giorgi, is usually helping me.

                    more than 10 years ago. In 2009, the Dog Organization of Georgia was founded and I

                    With all my heart I belong to the Freedom’s

                    and our society is mostly gathering in this place

                    I would like to apply to those people who are working
                    in the shelters: we dogs mostly want to have a place
                    to live in winter, when it gets darker outside and
                    people are afraid of us, however this doesn’t mean we

                    Main dangers for stray dogs are diseases. People
                    refuse to vaccinate dogs, which leads to the
                    spread of incredibly dangerous infections. These
                    infections are not dangerous for humans.

                    I am talking about distemper, a porvil virus which is

                    dangers. Other dangers include cars, accidents,
                    starvation because there is not enough food available.

                    When I am in the shelter my life completely
                    changes. Day starts with morning cleaning, after
                    this cleaning I feel very well. We eat our breakfast
                    around 7-8 oclock and then our friend organizes
                    morning exercises in the shelter. We go out for a
                    minimum of 4-5 hours, but usually most of the
                    day we spend in these groups in order not to be
                    locked in the kennels.

                <p>
                    Besides encouraging groups we are having meetings with volunteers. I adore taking morning exercises,
                    because they give me positive energy and
                    strengthen my body’s and face’s muscles for
                    eating and hunting. And now it’s winter and at 5-6
                    o’clock we are back to the kennels, we receive
                    tasty dinners and needed medications. At the end
                    of the day we are having final cleanings and disinfections due to Covid.

                    People prefer adopting hybrid dogs, rather than
                    adopting stray dogs. It is really difficult to explain
                    that purebred dogs are genetically weaker than
                    mixed stray dogs. Especially breeding in Georgia is
                    very unregulated, very dangerous for dogs. I would
                    like to encourage everyone to adopt mixed stray
                    dogs instead of purebred onse
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Georgia the situation is different: very often
                    people spend a lot of money to buy a dog that
                    they are not able to handle, that’s why suddenly
                    they end up in the street. This is why after 6
                    months of staying with dogs you become
                    eligible to be adopted abroad as well.

                    My name is Sara Kametry. I moved to Georgia
                    more than 10 years ago. In 2009, the Dog Organization of Georgia was founded and I
                    started volunteering there.

                    Our mission is to vaccinate dogs, bring them
                    to the shelter, do mass campaigns for them,
                    and also neuter them so that unwanted
                    puppies won’t be born
